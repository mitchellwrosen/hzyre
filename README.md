#### Overview

A totally incomplete Haskell implementation of the Zyre framework, to be hacked on intermittently, and possibly never be completed.

---

#### Building
```
git clone git@github.com:mitchellwrosen/hzyre.git
cd hzyre
stack test
```

---

#### Contributing

In true ZMQ fashion, contributions use the [C4.1 process](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:16) created by Pieter Hintjens,
as described in chapter 6 of [The Guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc141). TL;DR: Contributions are made 
using the fork+pull model, and this project is owned collectively by all contributors.
